<!--Challenge: Story Time-->
<p>When I was younger, I was young. Even though I was young, I was happy. I wished I was older because I was young. Now I am older, wishing I was young. Being older made me value youth.</p>
<p>When I was older than being young, I was living. Living because I had been young and became older. Now I know nothing about being older. Being young is valuable and yet, I am older. If I had know when I was younger, I would not have gotten older.</p>

<!--Challenge: Make Your Voice Heard-->
<h1>Reduce, Reuse, Recycle</h1>
<p>I'm passionate about the reduce, reuse, recyle initiative. The consumerist society we live in is wasteful. There are many actions we can take to minimize the amount of waste we generate. Simply using a grocery bag several times before disposal helps. Every little bit helps.</p>

<h1>Climate Change</h1>
<p>I'm passionate about making efforts to minimize climate change. We should walk to work whenever possible to cut down on emissions. We should turn off all the lights we aren't using so we don't waste electricity. I've heard that reducing the amount of meat I eat will help too, but I can't decide on this topic. We should also turn off the tap when we are brushing our teeth and take short showers.</p>

<h1>Gender Equality</h1>
<p>For many years, there has been a difference in the amount of money that men and women get paid for the same jobs. Women have historically been paid less for their efforts. I think that all people should be treated fairly and equally, no matter what kind of gender you identify with. Two people who have the same job and do the same work should get paid the same. People everywhere who agree should also speak up and make their voices heard!</p>
